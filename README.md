## 📌 Project Description

The competition required teams to design and simulate an **autonomous drone system** capable of real-time flight control, path planning, and task execution in a simulated environment. Our system is built with a modular, model-based design approach using:

- Autonomous control via **Simulink controllers**
- Airframe modeling (both linear and nonlinear)
- Sensor simulations
- Task scheduling and tracking logic
